This package provides an interface for interacting with the Marketo REST API.

The code is a revamped fork of [eventfarm/marketo-client](github.com/eventfarm/marketo-client). The internal architecture has been simplified, performance improved and helper functions added to aid integration into your consumer application.

# Installation

```
$ composer require netitus/marketo-client
```

Or add the following lines to your ``composer.json`` file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "netitus/marketo-client": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

```bash
$ composer install
```

# Implementation details

## Project Defaults

In order to get you up and running as easily as possible, we provide default implementations of a REST client and Marketo provider to use in combination with this package. 
* We've chosen to use [Guzzle](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle) for sending HTTP requests
* We've chosen to use [The PHP League's Oauth Client](https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-client) and KirstenLK's [Marketo provider](https://github.com/kristenlk/oauth2-marketo) for Marketo authentication and token refresh.

You can extend the client to implement your own interface to cache the access token, using the construct argument TokenRefreshCallback.   

## Guzzle REST Client

Our REST client implements the PSR-7 HTTP message interface.

You can either use the provided [GuzzleRestClient](./src/RestClient/GuzzleRestClient.php) or have your own that implements our [RestClientInterface](./src/RestClient/RestClientInterface.php).

## MarketoProvider

Our default Marketo OAuth2 provider is the [Marketo Provider](https://github.com/kristenlk/oauth2-marketo) library.

You can either use the provided [MarketoProvider](./src/Oauth/MarketoProvider.php) or use your own that implements our [MarketoProviderInterface](./src/Oauth/MarketoProviderInterface.php).

## Example Client Implementation

```php
<?php
namespace App;

use EventFarm\Marketo\Oauth\AccessToken;
use EventFarm\Marketo\MarketoClient;

class DemoMarketoAPI extends Marketo
{
    public function __cosntruct() {
        parent::__construct($this->getMarketoClient());
    }

    public function getMarketoClient():MarketoClient
    {
        if (empty($this->client)) {
            $this->client = MarketoClient::with(
                'CLIENT_ID',
                'CLIENT_SECRET',
                'BASE_URL',
                $this->getRefreshTokenFromCache(),               
                $this->tokenRefreshCallback
            );
        }
        return $this->client;
    }
    
    private function getRefreshTokenFromCache(): ?AccessToken {
        // get token from cache
        return new AccessToken('my_token', 300, 1642768705);
        // or return null
    }

    public function tokenRefreshCallback(AccessToken $token)
    {
        // store the token
    }
}
```

# Usage

The use of the Marketo helper interface is completely optional. All it does, is wrap the MarketoClient into the API endpoint abstractions.

> N.B.: Some implementations have changed during the overhaul and might not work as described below!

## Campaigns

### Get Campaigns
[Docs](http://developers.marketo.com/rest-api/endpoint-reference/lead-database-endpoint-reference/#!/Campaigns/getCampaignsUsingGET)

Returns a list of campaign records. Refer to the docs for the full list of options.

`public function getCampaigns(array $options = array())`

```php
<?php
$demoMarketo = new DemoMarketoAPI();

$options = [
  "programName" => "My Marketo Program",
  "batchSize" => 10
];

$campaigns = $demoMarketo->campaigns()->getCampaigns($options);
// getCampaigns() can also be called without options.
// $campaigns = { ... }
```

### Trigger Campaign
[Docs](http://developers.marketo.com/rest-api/endpoint-reference/lead-database-endpoint-reference/#!/Campaigns/triggerCampaignUsingPOST)

Passes a set of leads to a trigger campaign to run through the campaign's flow. Refer to the docs for the full list of options.

* A `campaignId` and an array of options that includes an `input` key (mapped to an array that contains arrays of lead data) must be passed to `triggerCampaign()`.

`public function triggerCampaign(int $campaignId, array $options)`

```php
<?php
$demoMarketo = new DemoMarketoAPI();

$campaignId = 1029;
$options = [
    "input" => [
        "leads" => [
            [
                "id" => 1234
            ]
        ]
    ]//, additional options
];

$campaign = $demoMarketo->campaigns()->triggerCampaign($campaignId, $options);
// $campaign = { ... }
```

## Lead Fields

### Get Lead Fields
[Docs](http://developers.marketo.com/rest-api/endpoint-reference/lead-database-endpoint-reference/#!/Leads/describeUsingGET_2)

Returns metadata about lead objects in the target instance, including a list of all fields available for interaction via the APIs.

`public function getLeadFields(array $options = array())`

```php
<?php
$demoMarketo = new DemoMarketoAPI();
$leadFields = $demoMarketo->leadFields()->getLeadFields();
// $leadFields = { ... }
```

## Leads

#### Create or Update Leads
[Docs](http://developers.marketo.com/rest-api/endpoint-reference/lead-database-endpoint-reference/#!/Leads/syncLeadUsingPOST)

Syncs a list of leads to the target instance. Refer to the docs for the full list of options.

* An array of options that includes an `input` key (mapped to an array that contains arrays of lead data) must be passed to `createOrUpdateLeads()`.

`public function createOrUpdateLeads(array $options)`

By default, Marketo sets the type of sync operation (`action`) to `createOrUpdate` and the `lookupField` to `email`. If using those defaults:
- Email is not required; if an email is not included in a lead array, Marketo will create a lead without an email.
- When an email is included, Marketo will search for existing leads with that email. If one is found, Marketo will update the found lead with the data sent; if one is not found, Marketo will create a new lead with the data sent.

```php
<?php
$demoMarketo = new DemoMarketoAPI();

$options = [
    "input" => [
        [
            "email" => "email1@example.com",
            "firstName" => "Example1First",
            "lastName" => "Example1Last"
        ],
        [
            "email" => "email2@example.com",
            "firstName" => "Example2First",
            "lastName" => "Example2Last"
        ]
    ]//, additional options
];

$leads = $demoMarketo->leads()->createOrUpdateLeads($options);
// $leads = { ... }
```

### Update Leads' Program Status
[Docs](http://developers.marketo.com/rest-api/endpoint-reference/lead-database-endpoint-reference/#!/Leads/changeLeadProgramStatusUsingPOST)

Changes the program status of a list of leads in a target program. Refer to the docs for the full list of options.

* A `programId` and an array of options that includes an `input` key (mapped to an array that contains arrays of lead data) and a `status` key (mapped to a program status) must be passed to `updateLeadsProgramStatus()`.

`public function updateLeadsProgramStatus(int $programId, array $options)`

```php
<?php
$demoMarketo = new DemoMarketoAPI();

$programId = 1234;
$options = [
    "input" => [
        [
            "id" => 1111
        ]
    ],
    "status" => "Registered"
];

$leads = $demoMarketo->leads()->updateLeadsProgramStatus($programId, $options);
// $leads = { ... }
```

### Get Leads by Program
[Docs](http://developers.marketo.com/rest-api/endpoint-reference/lead-database-endpoint-reference/#!/Leads/getLeadsByProgramIdUsingGET)

Retrieves a list of leads that are members of the designated program. Refer to the docs for the full list of options.

* A `programId` must be passed to `getLeadsByProgram()`.

`public function getLeadsByProgram(int $programId, array $options = array())`

```php
<?php
$demoMarketo = new DemoMarketoAPI();

$programId = 1234;
$options = [
    "fields" => 'firstName,lastName,email,middleName,mktoIsPartner';
];

$leads = $demoMarketo->leads()->getLeadsByProgram($programId, $options);
// getLeadsByProgram() can also be called without options.
// $leads = { ... }
```

## Lead Partitions
### Get Lead Partitions
[Docs](http://developers.marketo.com/rest-api/endpoint-reference/lead-database-endpoint-reference/#!/Leads/getLeadPartitionsUsingGET)

Returns a list of available partitions in the target instance. Refer to the docs for the full list of options.

`public function getPartitions(array $options = array())`

```php
<?php
$demoMarketo = new DemoMarketoAPI();

$partitions = $demoMarketo->partitions()->getPartitions();
// $partitions = { ... }
```

## Programs
